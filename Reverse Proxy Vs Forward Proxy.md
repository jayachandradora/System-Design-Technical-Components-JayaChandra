### Details of Reverse Vs Forward Proxy 

The diagram below shows the differences between a 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲 and a 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲. <br>

🔹 A forward proxy is a server that sits between user devices and the internet.<br>

A forward proxy is commonly used for: <br>
1️⃣ Protect clients<br>
2️⃣ Avoid browsing restrictions<br>
3️⃣ Block access to certain content<br>

🔹 A reverse proxy is a server that accepts a request from the client, forwards the request to web servers, 
and returns the results to the client as if the proxy server had processed the request.<br>

A reverse proxy is good for:<br>
1️⃣ Protect servers<br>
2️⃣ Load balancing<br>
3️⃣ Cache static contents<br>
4️⃣ Encrypt and decrypt SSL communications<br>
