iQIYI is one of the largest online video sites in the world, with over 500 million monthly active users. Let's look at how they choose relational and NoSQL databases.<br>
 
The following databases are used at iQIYI:<br>
- MySQL<br>
- Redis<br>
- TiDB: a hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) distributed database<br>
- Couchbase: distributed multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database<br>
- TokuDB: open-source storage engine for MySQL and MariaDB.<br>
- Big data analytical systems, like Hive and Impala<br>
- Other databases, like MongoDB, HiGraph, and TiKV<br>
